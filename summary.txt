This project, as indicated by its name, translates a given Tweet in 
English to a specified language. We utilize both the Twitter and Google 
Translate APIs and chose to code in Python as it is more conducive to 
working with these APIs. We use the Python wrapper Tweepy to implement 
the Twitter API and the Python wrapper googletrans to implement the 
Google Translate API. 

Our program asks a user for a Twitter username (also known as a handle),
the number of Tweets he/she wants to translate, and whether or not they
want to include Retweets by that user. The program then passes these 
as arguments to the getTweets() function, uses Tweepy’s .user_timeline() 
function and writes the resulting Tweet(s) to a file, encodes the file
in UTF-8 to handle special characters, and then passes that file to 
the translateTextFile() function, which creates a file with the 
translated Tweet using googletrans’ .translate() function. Lastly, we 
use Tweepy’s .update_status() function to Tweet out the translated 
file to the authenticated user’s (the account that provides the API keys
and tokens) account. 

We spilt this project between the two APIs. Conner wrote the code and 
implemented the Twitter API and Connor did the same for the Google 
Translate API. Additionally, we split testing between the two APIs. 

If we had more time, we would fully implement a listener that waited for
a specified user to Tweet and would then translate that Tweet right as 
it was published. Further, we would add a gui to make the UX more user 
friendly and interactive. As Python is more compatible with websites, 
we would also like to host our program on a webpage.
